# Insert Sarcasm Here (ISH)
Responsive Blog Design, built with HTML 5, CSS 3, and Vanilla JS. Includes "Konami Code" easter eggs. 

This is a blog concept that I built for a blog that I wanted to start up. I wanted it to be more daily diary/reflection
one-off without the bulk of a comment section, upvote/downvote etc. 

This blog does not use any frameworks, and is built off of a minimal HTML/CSS/JS stack. The website is 
fully mobile responsive thanks in part of REM units being used for page scaling. It was designed for 
multi-page use, but its hard to replicate multipage use with github only offering one-page site per 
project.
